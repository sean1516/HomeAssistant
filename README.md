These are the [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) configuration files used in my Home Assistant (HA) setup. I relied on repositories of other HA users quite a bit when I was getting started for ideas and example code.  Hopefully this repository will help someone else who is getting started. 

# Automations:
A detailed description of each of my automations and a link to the yaml file is located [HERE](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/tree/master/automation#bedtime_notificationsyaml-automations)

This is the most important part of Home Assistant!  Remote control and voice commmands are nice, however, that is not home automation, just remote control.  Automations should make your life easier, look at what you do everyday, the simplest things, and automate them.  To me Home Automation is collecting data about your home and automatically acting based on that data.

# Server Running My Home Assistant Setup:
I am currently using a [Dell Optiplex 9010 Small Form Factor (SFF)](http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/Dell_OptiPlex_9010_spec_sheet.pdf) as my host.
This desktop has a i5 3470T (low power CPU) swapped in.  The machine is running __[Ubuntu Server 18.04](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server)__ and __[Hass.io](https://www.home-assistant.io/hassio/)__.  I am also running the following add-ons:
* __[DuckDNS](www.home-assistant.io/addons/duckdns/)__ Provides DuckDNS updates and creates a Lets Encrypt Certificate
* __[Mosquitto MQTT broker](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/mosquitto/)__ MQTT Broker
* __[Network UPS Tools](https://github.com/asciinaut/hassio-addons)__ A NUT Server
* __[Pi-Hole](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-pi-hole/blob/master/README.md)__ DNS Server / Ad Blocker
* __[RPC Shutdown](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/rpc_shutdown/)__ Shutdown Windows Computers
* __[SSH & Web Terminal](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-ssh/blob/master/README.md)__ SSH for Hass.io
* __[Samba](https://www.home-assistant.io/addons/samba/)__ Samba share of config files and backup files
* __[TasmoAdmin](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-tasmoadmin)__ Easy managment of tasmota flashed devices
* __[Unifi Controller](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-unifi)__ Unifi Device Controller
* __[Dasshio](https://github.com/theastropath/dasshio)__ Simple add-on to use Amazon Dash buttons to make service calls. 

I'm currently running [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) version __0.79.3__.

# Network & Home Assistant Instance Security:
I think this is an often overlooked part of any internet connected project.  I am far from a security expert, however, these are the steps I have taken to add some level of security to my Home Assistant instance.
- Simple protections like enabling a [password](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/blob/master/configuration.yaml#L38) and limiting the number of incorrect [login attempts](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/blob/master/configuration.yaml#L42).
- Anything that doesn't need an internet connection is blocked from any inbound or outbound traffic at the router level.
- I separate my traffic into different subnets and by default these subnets cannot talk to one another.  For example my devices on Wifi only have access to the internet or my Local Area Network (LAN) if I allow it.  
- Using the port forwarding options in my [Unifi Security Gateway](https://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Unifi-Security-Gateway-USG/dp/B00LV8YZLK) I limit the connections to my open port to only IPs I typically connect from.  Port Scanners and the like do not see an open port or a service running on that port!
- Failed login attempts to the Home Assistant Front end generate a [notification](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/blob/master/automation/pc_security.yaml#L23) to me with the source IP.
- Frontend log-ins are tracked using a [Custom Component](https://github.com/custom-components/sensor.authenticated)
- My Home Assistant Traffic is encrypted with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).  I used [this guide](https://www.splitbrain.org/blog/2017-08/10-homeassistant_duckdns_letsencrypt) to get it setup.

# Editing the Configuration Files:
What works for me is creating a Samba share that I can then edit on any computer in my house.  I am doing this with the Samba add-on for Hass.io.  For other install methods [this](https://github.com/SilvrrGIT/HomeAssistant/wiki/Hassbian-Quick-Reference-Sheet#setting-up-a-samba-share) is a good tutorial. 

After you have the Samba share setup, I like to use [Atom](https://atom.io/) to edit my files.  It works on both Windows and Linux, has a great interface and some nice features. [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) is also easy to use and is a bit more lightweight than Atom (no Linux support though)

If you are just getting started with Home Assistant I highly recommend checking out this [YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgtGAtCt_hGTc_GAEmMhQ_XVs80mZoBIG).  It helped me a lot in the beginning and I still frequently reference some videos today.  I also strongly recommend you read the [Home Assistant Docs](https://home-assistant.io/docs/).  So many questions asked on the  [Home Assistant Forum](https://community.home-assistant.io/) could be solved by reading the docs. I have tried to include links in my files to the associated guidance documents for easy reference.
